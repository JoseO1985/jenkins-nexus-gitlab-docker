```
You can also run all services in the background (detached mode) by adding the `-d` flag to the above command.
> :information_source: You must run `docker-compose build` first whenever you switch branch or update a base image.
If you are starting the stack for the very first time, please read the section below attentively.

### Cleanup

In order to entirely shutdown the stack and remove all persisted data, use the following Docker Compose command:
```console
$ docker-compose down -v
```

## Configuration
> :information_source: Configuration is not dynamically reloaded, you will need to restart individual components after
any configuration change.
### How to configure GitLab
